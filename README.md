# EventvDriven Serverless Image Processing Pipeline using AWS Lambda and S3
## Project Introduction
This project implements an event-driven image processing pipeline using AWS Lambda and S3, designed to provide automated, scalable, and efficient image manipulation. The system leverages the power of serverless technology to perform tasks such as resizing images to multiple dimensions, and extracting valuable metadata like dimensions, format, and file size.

The solution is ideal for modern applications that demand high scalability and cost-efficiency, such as content management systems, social media platforms, e-commerce websites, or any service requiring robust image processing capabilities. By utilizing AWS Lambda's pay-as-you-go model, the pipeline minimizes operational costs while delivering high performance.

## Uses of Pixelation (Objective of the project)
Pixelation can be used in multiple ways, some of them are:

1. Privacy and Anonymity: Obscures sensitive information like faces, license plates, or personal data in images and videos to ensure privacy.
   
2. Content Moderation: Censors explicit, sensitive, or age-restricted content on social media platforms, providing a preview without revealing details.

3. Artistic and Creative Applications: Creates retro-style pixel art, adds creative filters, or applies pixelated effects for abstract art and digital design.
   
4. Low-Resolution Previews: Displays lightweight, pixelated image previews for faster loading in web or mobile applications, reducing bandwidth usage.

5. Gaming and Virtual Reality: Used for retro-style graphics in games or to optimize rendering performance by pixelating distant objects in VR/AR environments.
